OpenProject Meeting Plugin
==========================

This plugin adds functions to support project meetings to
[OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org). Meetings
can be scheduled selecting invitees from the same project to take
part in the meeting. An agenda can be created and sent to the invitees.
After the meeting, attendants can be selected and minutes can be
created based on the agenda. Finally, the minutes can be sent to
all attendants and invitees.

A more detailed feature tour can be found [here](https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Meetings).
